Thank you everyone for an amazing year of Student Music Initiatives! We raised \$4345.31 for the American Cancer Society and Feeding America, enough to give over 50 free rides to cancer patients, provide lifesaving cancer research, and feed over 7000 children. Additionally, this means that we raised more money than any other year in SMI history!

Almost 100 volunteers from across three schools (Inglemoor, Bothell, and Mariner) contributed more than 1000 volunteer hours cumulatively over the course of 75 hours of performances! Not only that, but we also helped spread the joy of music for thousands!

We once again thank everyone for their hard work and volunteer efforts, and we look forward to 2024-2025!

Most sincerely,
Kairui Cheng
